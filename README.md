# sprite-tester
## A Sprite submission and evaluation tool for use with ALttPR.

This project uses the code-igniter framework to create a web app designed to manage custom sprite submissions for A Link to the Past Randomizer.
Sensitive information like username/passwords for the database connection have been removed for security purposes. This Readme file is a work in progress, which will eventually lay out all of the components of this project and the process for contributing/testing.
